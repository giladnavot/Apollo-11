# Overview of the Master Ignition routine

The Master Ignition routine is a recently added feature in our codebase that handles the ignition process for a specific component. This section provides an overview of how the Master Ignition routine is implemented and how it interacts with the rest of the system.

## Step 1: Initialization

The Master Ignition routine starts with the initialization phase. During this phase, the necessary variables and resources are set up to ensure the smooth execution of the routine. This includes initializing the necessary data structures and configuring any required settings.

As can be seen in the code snippet from `path/to/initialization.ts` (see snippet), the initialization phase involves setting up the necessary variables and performing any required setup tasks.

## Step 2: Pre-Ignition Checks

Once the initialization phase is complete, the Master Ignition routine proceeds to perform pre-ignition checks. These checks ensure that all the necessary conditions are met before the ignition process can begin. This may include verifying the availability of required resources, checking for any potential errors or conflicts, and validating input parameters.

As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/pre_ignition_checks.ts` (see snippet), the pre-ignition checks involve validating various conditions and performing necessary verifications.

## Step 3: Ignition Process

After the pre-ignition checks pass successfully, the Master Ignition routine proceeds with the actual ignition process. This process involves executing a series of steps to initiate the ignition of

## Processing the ignition sequence

The ignition sequence in the Master Ignition routine is responsible for initiating the startup process of the system. This section will explain how the ignition sequence is processed in our codebase.

1.  The ignition sequence begins by checking the status of the ignition switch. This is done by calling the `checkIgnitionSwitch()` function (see snippet from `path/to/ignition.ts`). The `checkIgnitionSwitch()` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the ignition switch is turned on or off.

2.  Once the ignition switch is confirmed to be turned on, the system proceeds to validate the ignition key. This is done by calling the `validateIgnitionKey()` function (see snippet from `path/to/ignition.ts`). The `validateIgnitionKey()` function performs a series of checks to ensure that the ignition key is valid and authorized.

3.  After the ignition key is validated, the system moves on to the next step which is initializing the ignition components. This is done by calling the `initializeIgnitionComponents()` function (see snippet from `path/to/ignition.ts`). The `initializeIgnitionComponents()` function initializes all the necessary components required for the ignition process, such as fuel pumps, spark plugs, and ignition coils.

4.  Once the ignition components are initialized, the system proceeds to ignite the fuel mixture. This is done by calling the `igniteFuelMixture()` function (see snippet from)
