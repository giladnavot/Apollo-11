# File Structure

The file structure in the 'Apollo-11' repository follows a specific convention to organize the source code for the Command Module (Comanche055) and Lunar Module (Luminary099) of the Apollo 11 mission.

The main files and directories in the file structure are as follows:

*   `Comanche055`: This directory contains the source code for the Command Module's Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) program, Comanche055. This program is part of the source code for Colossus 2A, the Command Module's AGC for Apollo 11.

*   `Luminary099`: This directory contains the source code for the Lunar Module's Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) program, Luminary099. This program is part of the source code for Luminary 1A, the Lunar Module's AGC for Apollo 11.

*   `Assembler`: This directory contains the yaYUL assembler, which is used to assemble the AGC source code.

In addition to these main directories, there may be other files and directories in the repository that are related to the original Apollo 11 source code.

Please refer to the specific directories for more details on the source code and files contained within them.

For more information on how to contribute to the repository, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

# Conventions

In the 'Apollo-11' repository, we follow certain conventions to maintain consistency and readability in our codebase. These conventions include naming conventions, code formatting, and documentation standards.

## Naming Conventions

We use the following naming conventions in our code:

*   **Variables**: Variables are named using camel case, starting with a lowercase letter. For example, `myVariable`.

*   **Functions**: Function names are also written in camel case, starting with a lowercase letter. For example, `myFunction`.

*   **Constants**: Constants are written in uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores. For example, `MY_CONSTANT`.

## Code Formatting

We adhere to a consistent code formatting style to ensure readability and maintainability. Some key points of our code formatting conventions include:

*   **Indentation**: We use 4 spaces for indentation.

*   **Line Length**: We aim to keep lines of code within 80 characters to improve readability.

*   **Braces**: We use the "Allman style" for braces, where opening and closing braces are placed on separate lines.

## Documentation Standards

We believe in the importance of clear and comprehensive documentation. In our codebase, we follow these documentation standards:

*   **Inline Comments**: We use inline comments to provide explanations and clarifications for complex code sections or to highlight important information.

*   **Function/Method Documentation**: Each function or method should have a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return values.

*   \*\*File-Level
